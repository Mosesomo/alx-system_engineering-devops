Postmortem Report: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

.Duration of Outage:
	-Start Time: January 21, 2024, 15:30 UTC
	-End Time: January 21, 2024, 18:45 UTC
.Impact:
	-The outage affected the authentication service, leading to a complete disruption in user logins.
	-Approximately 35% of users experienced login failures during the incident.

.Root Cause:
	-The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing it to drop valid authentication requests.


Timeline:

.Issue Detection:
	Detected at 15:30 UTC through automated monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in failed authentication attempts.

.Detection Method:
	Monitoring system triggered alerts based on a sudden spike in error rates for authentication requests.

.Misleading Paths:
	Initially suspected a database issue, leading to unnecessary checks and optimizations.

.Escalation:
	Incident was escalated to the DevOps team after initial investigations by the development team yielded no conclusive results.

.Resolution:
	Discovered a misconfiguration in the load balancer that was dropping valid requests.
	

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:

The load balancer misconfiguration was caused by a recent update that inadvertently altered authentication request handling rules.
Resolution Details:

Load balancer settings were reverted to a known good state before the update, resolving the issue immediately.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Strengthen monitoring of load balancer configurations to quickly detect misconfigurations.
Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations in the deployment pipeline.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Create documentation outlining best practices for load balancer configuration.
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations across all services.
Implement a post-deployment validation step to ensure load balancer changes align with service requirements.

Conclusion:

The outage was swiftly addressed by identifying and rectifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Post-incident, we are implementing measures to fortify our monitoring and testing processes to prevent similar issues in the future.
